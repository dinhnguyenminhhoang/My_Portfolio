  about: {
    story: `My journey into floral design began with a simple love for nature's beauty, which has evolved into a deep understanding of how flowers can transform spaces, emotions, and memories. With over 5 years of experience, I've had the privilege of creating arrangements for hundreds of special occasions.
    
    What drives me is the joy I see in my clients' faces when they see their vision come to life. Whether it's a bride's first glimpse of her bouquet or the moment guests enter a beautifully decorated venue, these reactions fuel my passion for this art form.
    
    I believe that every flower has a story to tell, and I'm here to help you tell yours through the timeless beauty of floral design.`,
